    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>My site will consist of a front page and 5 similarly-structured sub-pages that represent the different stages of the entire birth process:</p>
    <br>
        <h3>Front Page</h3>
            <h4>Nav Bar and Background</h4>
                <p>The entire website will have the same collapsable Navbar at the top with the site logo and links to Home (the front page) and each sub-page.  The logo will also be the background and will remain stationary while the rest of the content scrolls across the screen.</p>
            <h4>Welcome</h4>
                <p>A welcome message from my wife that gives a little information about herself and why she created the website.  It also includes a brief explanation about what you'll find in this website.</p>
            <h4>Contact Me</h4>
                <p>This section will contain a simple way to get in touch with my wife.  It will include a space to enter name, email, and a brief message to get in touch with her.  It will also include website creation credit to me with my professional email and links to my social media profiles.</p>
    <br>
        <h3>Sub-Pages</h3>
            <h4>Nav Bar and Background</h4>
                <p>The same Navbar and backround as the front page.</p>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This section will have a personal message from my wife relevant to the birth stage that the sub-page is about.  It will include text and a circular picture.</p>
            <h4>Lists</h4>
                <p>This section will have two lists next to each other: one </p>
